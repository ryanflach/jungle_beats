###Jungle Beats

A command-line Ruby application that allows the user to create a "beat" using strings.

The user's beat is played via the `play` method (utilizing the built-in `say` commmand).

This version of the application also allows the user to set the computer rate and voice.

####Basic Instructions:
* Clone this repo to your local machine and cd into the directory.
* From the main directory (`/jungle_beats`), type `ruby lib/jb_player.rb`.
* Follow the on-screen instructions and have fun making and playing your beats!
